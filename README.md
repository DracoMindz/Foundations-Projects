# Foundations Learning

The first three trimesters of learning at Holberton School are where you learnin the basics of software
engineering.  It took me from barely knowing anything about writing code to where I was working with
servers to create a back end for a website.  I was creating functions I learned about while creating
them.  We created all the functions we would later use to complete projects. We started with learning all about C. By the end of foundations we had completed projects using Javscript, Python3, Puppet, and CSS.

I have included some projects I completed in Foundations. I started out as teacher who wanted to learn
to code. Now I am more and more accepting that I am a Software Engineer who likes to talk about code and what it can do.
