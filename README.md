Included in this reposityory are projects completed during Foundations.

The first three trimesters of learning at Holberton School you learn the basics of software engineering. When I started I did not know a lot about writing code.  I learned to write code by creating functions in C.  We created all the functions we would later use to complete projects. By the end of foundations we had completed projects using Javscript, HTML, Python3, Puppet, and CSS.

Before studying at Holberton School I was a teacher who wanted to learn to code. Now I am more of a Software Engineer who likes to talk about code and what it can do.
